# Coding-assessment-l2-Boilerplate-code
This Project is basically for add to cart product. In cart there is options to choose the colors and size and also you can choose product quantity. How much product you want to buy and if you click on add to cart button I will appear the message what you have selected like color, size, In message message will *show like Embrace Sideboard with Color Yellow, Size Small added to cart*.

By creating this project I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
-> HTML I used for content structure.
-> CSS I used for giving my structure to styling, also for making my project responsive I used media Query.
-> JavaScript I used for giving my project functionality like how works when I do something in my project, like click, select, add etc.
