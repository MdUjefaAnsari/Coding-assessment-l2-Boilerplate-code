# By creating this project I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
-> HTML I used for content structure.<br>
-> CSS I used for giving my structure to styling, also for making my project responsive I used media Query.<br>
-> JavaScript I used for giving my project functionality like how works when I do something in my project, like click, select, add etc.<br>
